üìΩÔ∏è CineNest - Movie Explorer App
A React-based movie discovery app that lets users browse popular movies, search by title, and manage their favourites. Powered by the TMDB API, CineNest features a clean UI, localStorage support for favourites, and dynamic routing for detailed movie views.

üß† Inspiration: This project was inspired by this YouTube tutorial by Tech With Tim. I followed the base structure and extended it by adding additional features and improvements.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
